# CS-350-Emerging-Systems-Architecture-and-Technology




    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    
    I believe that I was successfully able to read the given code, understand it, and then understand how to implement the needed code to make the program and microcontroller to fulfill the needed tasks.
    
    Where could you improve?
    
    I believe I could improve my speed over time. This project took me quite a while to finish. 
    
    What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    
    I have added some classmates as well as some resources like the Zybook we used and websites that I visited to help me work through assignments.
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    
    I think the ability to understand what code is doing as a software engineer is very important. There will be much more frequent that I am adding or altering existing code than writing it from start. Reading and understanding code is something that I feel comfortable doing and is a skill that will be particularly transferrable throughout my other projects, course work, and beyond. 
    
    How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    
    I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using reusable functions and state machines throughout our assignments.
